Our mission is to make construction primarily software-defined and work towards a future where beautiful, bespoke buildings are built quickly and efficiently, with minimal labour.

Monumental are developing AI-driven robots that autonomously build walls with sub-millimetre precision. Our team has designed all hardware and software in-house. Weâ€™re deploying our bricklaying robots to construction sites across the Netherlands to address Europe's skilled labour shortage.

Our software stack is very broad, covering everything from microcontroller firmware up to the UI that operators use to control the robots. We've built CAD tools for designing masonry structures, path planning and motion control, telemetry and inspection tools, and distributed data storage and sync.
The technical challenges we're solving combine hardware, software, and infrastructure at scale - while maintaining high availability on construction sites.

[Atrium, our operating system for construction](https://www.monumental.co/atrium), is built with TypeScript and Rust. Much of our Rust code is compiled to WebAssembly, allowing our UI to interface directly with the same control code that we deployed to our robots. This gives us a shared stack between real-world deployments and simulated runs in the front-end.

Help us bring our robots to life and join our mission to bring automation to the construction industry to create affordable, beautiful, high-quality housing for everyone. If you're new to robotics, you should read Bouke's post about [getting in robotics as a software engineer](https://bou.ke/blog/robotics/).

We're at an inflection point, we are making revenue, have strong customer demand and are scaling up our team and production to deliver a growing pipeline of deployments.

We value high ownership, and practical problem-solving. We value generalists who want to make real world impact by coding, prototyping hardware, or running robots on-site

If you're tired of Saas, excited to build products that touch the physical world, and want to help influence the future of construction, apply below!
